✨ Highlights

📁 Easily upload Content and Style images via file dialog

🧠 Powered by VGG19 pretrained model for deep feature extraction

🎨 Generates a new image combining both style and content

📷 Instantly preview Content, Style, and Stylized Output within the UI

🚀 Automatically uses GPU when available, otherwise runs on CPU

💾 Saves the final image to the /outputs folder
